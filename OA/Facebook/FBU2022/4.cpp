Your task to check whether it is possible to construct a given array of integers from a bunch of given pieces.

More formally, you are given an array of distinct non-negative integers arr and an array of integer arrays pieces. Your task is to check whether it is possible to arrange the arrays of pieces in such a way that they can be concatenated to form an array equal to arr (containing all the same elements in the same order).
